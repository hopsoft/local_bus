== Key Resources

=== Official Documentation
* Socketry Async: https://github.com/socketry/async

IMPORTANT: Focus on understanding concurrency concepts before implementation details.

TIP: Start with high-level architecture design before diving into specific implementations.

NOTE: Consider failure modes and recovery strategies from the beginning.
